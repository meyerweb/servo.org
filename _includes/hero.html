        Servoâ€™s mission is to provide an independent, modular, embeddable web engine,
        which allows developers to deliver content and applications using web
        standards.

        Servo is written in <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a>, and shares code with Mozilla
        Firefox and the wider Rust ecosystem. Since its creation in 2012, Servo has contributed to
        W3C/WHATWG web standards by reporting specification issues and submitting new
        cross-browser automated tests, and core team members have co-edited new
        standards that have been adopted by other browsers. As a result, the Servo
        project helps drive the entire web platform forward while building on a
        platform of reusable, modular technologies that implement web standards.
